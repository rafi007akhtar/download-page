# download-page

This is a command-line tool that works as a web-crawler. 
It fetches all the HTML code from a given URL, and dumps them onto an HTML file of a randomly-made folder.

## Usage

```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/rafi007akhtar/download-page.git

# Enter the root folder
cd download-page

# Run index.js using Node, and provide a URL to scrap as a command-line arg
# For example:
node index.js https://rafi007akhtar.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/
```
